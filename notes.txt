I would be a lot easier if a user was created manually first.

However, we can automate it. Just makes it a bit more complex.

Some notes on this.


Automatic user-create
=====================

I thought we could try and use some of the code from lat-users

What user info do we want ?

if ($user not exists) {
$uid = &FindUid;

}


my %user = ("FirstName", $fields[1],
             "LastName", $fields[2],
             "PasswordSet", "no",
             "Uid",$uid,
             "Dept", $fields[4],
             "Company", $fields[5],
             "Shell", "/usr/bin/rssh",
             "VPNClientAccess","no",
             "Street", $fields[6],
             "City", $fields[7],
             "Phone", $fields[8],
             "EmailForward", $fields[9],
             "ForwardAddress", $fields[10]);


Create account $username uid:$uid
Set password
Set groups - which ones ?
Set pseudonym ?


What do we do with a password? Mail it to admin? Show it on screen after install?

User templates
==============

If we only want templates for this specific user then I guess we need something like

if ($user='printpdf') {
$OUT .= "some code"
}

So the relevant scripts are only created for the specific user.

Script permissions
==================

Normally we would set these using template.metadata

I'm not sure what happens if we only have templates in one users directory?
